# Build-a-minigame-console-app-with-GitHub-Copilot-
With Codespaces configured, your goal is to develop the Python console minigame. You need to create the game logic following the specifications and use GitHub Copilot to help create the methods.
Specification
Game rules:

Rock beats scissors (breaking it).
Scissors beat paper (cutting it).
Paper beat rock (wrapping it).
The minigame is multiplayer and the computer plays the role of your opponent and chooses a random element from the list of elements
Interaction with the player:

The console is used to interact with the player.
The player can choose one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
The player can choose whether to play again.
The player should be warned if they enter an invalid option.
The player is shown their score at the end of the game.
Validation of user input:

At each round, the player must enter one of the options in the list and be informed if they won, lost, or tied with the opponent.
The minigame must handle user inputs, putting them in lowercase and informing the user if the option is invalid.
By the end of each round, the player must answer whether they want to play again or not.
Using Visual Studio Code in your browser and GitHub Copilot to assist you, create a minigame that meets the above specifications.
